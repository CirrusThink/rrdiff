rrdiff - Ruby bindings to librsync/rdiff.

Lets say you have two files oldfile and newfile where newfile
is a modified version of oldfile. We want to be able to apply
the change to oldfile such that it becomes newfile.

The first process is to create a signature for the oldfile. The
parameters are the original file and where you want to store
the signature file.

    RRDiff.signature("oldfile", "sigfile")

Then from the newfile and the sigfile generate a delta. Deltafile
is where the delta is stored.

    RRDiff.delta("newfile", "sigfile", "deltafile")

Finally, apply the deltafile to the oldfile to create the patchedfile
which should be equivalent to newfile.

    RRDiff.patch("oldfile", "deltafile", "patchedfile")
